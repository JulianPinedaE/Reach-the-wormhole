# Reach-the-wormhole
As the title says, the objective is to reach the wormhole, use the WASD keys to move the ball, press the space bar to jump and hold it down to activate the jetpack. 
The blue bar in the upper right corner shows the oxygen and the orange the jetpack fuel, both bars recharge when the ball hits any surface. 
If you run out of oxygen, you lose.
You can adjust the movement of the ball and the force of the jetpack from the inspector as well as other game mechanics.
